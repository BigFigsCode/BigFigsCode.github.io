        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Brandon Figueroa, a passionate developer with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in technology, with a particular focus on programming, game development, and web development. I have hands-on experience with several programming languages, including Java, C, C++, C#, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that push my skills forward.
        I also served in the United States Marine Corps, where I developed a solid foundation in leadership, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, discipline, and adaptability. Among these, adaptability stands out as my strongest skill—I believe the ability to quickly adjust to new situations leads to clearer decisions and more effective outcomes.</p>
