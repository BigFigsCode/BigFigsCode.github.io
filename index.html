        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a Computer Science graduate and junior software developer with experience in Java, C/C++, C#, and front-end web development. I enjoy building clean, functional applications and learning new technologies through hands-on projects. I’m currently seeking an entry-level or junior developer role where I can grow, contribute, and continue sharpening my skills.</p>

        <p>I also served in the United States Marine Corps, where I developed a solid foundation in leadership, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, discipline, and adaptability. Among these, adaptability stands out as my strongest skill—I believe the ability to quickly adjust to new situations leads to clearer decisions and more effective outcomes.</p>
