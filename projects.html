            <h2>Project 1: Fitness Workout Planner</h2>
            <p>This is an academic project that was developed during my capstone courses. It was made with a team of 4 members from my class. We used the SCRUM which is an Agile Framework for managing complex projects. Here is a link to that project on github <a href="https://github.com/BigFigsCode/Fitness-Workout-Planner-Capstone-Project-"> Click here!</a></p>

            <h2>Project 2: Online Book Store(The Lit Lounge)</h2>
            <p>This was a project that I made for a web app development course I took during my academic studies. There is Javascript involved to handle the Cart page wich includes adding, deleting and calculating the total of the items. *Disclaimer* It is not fully polished but in terms finctionality everything works fine. Here is the link to my github repostory of that <a href="https://github.com/BigFigsCode/The-Lit-Lounge"> Click here!</a></p>
